# Express.js
*What is Express.js?*
Express.js is a web framework based on the core of Node.js (http) module and connect (http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/) components. The components are called middleware and they are cornerstones of the framework philosophy, which is configuration over convention.  In other words, Express.js systems are highly configurable, which allows developers freely pick whatever libraries they need for a particular project. For these reasons, the Express.js framework leads to flexibility and high customization in the development of the web applications.
