Truthy & Falsy Values in JavaScript

Before we begin looking at logical expressions,
which rely on the truthiness of statements to 
derive validity of the expression, we should 
have a solid understanding of what is truthy in 
JavaScript. Since JavaScript is loosely typed, 
values can be coerced into booleans to evaluate 
logical expressions. if conditions, &&, ||, and 
the part of a ternary statement preceding the 
question mark (_?_:_) all coerce their evaluated 
values into booleans. (Note that this doesn’t mean 
that they necessarily return a boolean from the operation.) 
The shortcut to knowing what is truthy is to know that 
there are only six falsy values — false, null, undefined,
 NaN, 0, and '' — and everything else is truthy. 
This means that [] and {} are both truthy.
