Week 3 Session notes

Today we are going to learn about javascript. We can go to ecma-international.org.
Google script is using V8. The cloud based server is written in java script. We are going to use Google chrome. 
There are lots of framework for javascript. The most popular ones are node.js.
We are going to download the node.js.


The code includes is npm install.
npm?

We are going to create a repository and create a node.js
Git will allow the value to change. 

Constant Declaration
This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the window object, unlike var variables. An initializer for a constant is required; that is, you must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared (which makes sense, given that it can't be changed later).
The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.
A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.

JavaScript Number:
In JavaScript, Number is a numeric data type in the double-precision 64-bit floating point format (IEEE 754). In other programming languages different numeric types can exist, for examples: Integers, Floats, Doubles, or Bignums.
In javascript we don't find

Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
